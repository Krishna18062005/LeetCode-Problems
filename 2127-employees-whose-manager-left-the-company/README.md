<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-whose-manager-left-the-company">2127. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><p>Table: <code>Employees</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than <code>$30000</code> and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the <code>Employees</code> table, but the reports still have their <code>manager_id</code> set to the manager that left.</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>employee_id</code>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel&#39;s manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah&#39;s manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
